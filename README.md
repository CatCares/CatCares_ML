### Background
Cats are excellent pets for many people because of their adorable behavior. Many people are willing to spend money on cat care and food. However, cats are also often infected by diseases such as skin diseases. One of the skin diseases that cats often suffer from is ringworm. Ringworm skin disease itself is easily transmitted through physical contact, so humans who keep cats are easy to contract ringworm. Therefore, one of the preventions that can be done is early detection of disease in cats.

The problems that often occur are the reason for us to build an application that is able to check the health of cat pets against ringworm disease. This application uses the input of a photo to predict the potential for ringworm disease in order to monitor the health of the pet itself. Users only need to upload photos of their cats into the application, so the application will predict the potential for ringworm disease. After that, they will be given related articles to find out the solution to the problems that the pet is experiencing. Our group wanted to create this application to improve the health level of cat pets.
